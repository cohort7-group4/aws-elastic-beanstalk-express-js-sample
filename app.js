                                   I wasn't part of the last session but i enjoyed watching the videos. I was able to successfully build, run my codepipeline and delete all the resources. 
                                    I did notice that health monitoring is set up when we setup out Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. For some strange reason after I ran my first build, I made some code changes then ran another successful build.
                                    This time around my health monitoring had the status as severe and i was unable to view my application in the URL
                                   I hope someone runs this build from here so that you can see this my plenty talk!));

app.listen(port);
console.log(`App running on http://localhost:${port}`);
